# My Python Learning Journey
This repository contains my first Python projects as I work towards becoming a developer.
**list_practice.py**: A script that manages an inventory list and adds new items
**search_logic.py**: A search tool to check if an item is available
**price_list.py**: A dictionary-based script that shows product prices
2. **goal_tracker.py**: A program that tracks monthly earnings until a $1000 goal is reached.
